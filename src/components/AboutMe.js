                with technologies such as Java, C#, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, Redux, Node js, Express js, MongoDB, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I aspire to be a
                full stack engineer as I enjoy working with the front end and back end. I have always been
                fascinated with technology. I love the logic, algorithms, and puzzles that come along with
                programming.</p>
