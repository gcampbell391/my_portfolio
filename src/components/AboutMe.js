            <p className="aboutMeParagraph">I have 3 years experience working with programming. I don't have any professional experience
            yet as a software engineer, but I'm currently seeking employment. I have experience working
            with Java, C#, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, Redux, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I aspire to be a
            full stack engineer as I enjoy working with the front end and back end. I have always been
            fascinated with technology. I love the logic, algorithms, and puzzles that come along with
            programming.  I'm currently looking for a jr developer or entry level position as a software
            engineer. If you're interested in any of my prior projects please check out my Github account
            and YouTube channel in the nav bar. You can also check out my blogs that are published on
