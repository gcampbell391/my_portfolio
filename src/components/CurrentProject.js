            <p className="currentProjectDesc">The current week is 7/5/20 - 7/11/20. I finally completed my Node js course on Udemy!
            I have another deployed application to show off my new Node js skills. You can check it out below in the deployed section or by
            clicking here: <a href="https://chit-chatter-app.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chit Chatter</a>.
            It's a chat application created with Node js, express, and socket.io. I started my official job search with Flatiron on Monday
            July the 6th! I'm very excited to land my first job as a software engineer. I also posted a new <a href="https://medium.com/@gcampbell391/the-real-og-open-graph-tags-8c681361b7f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> .
            It's about Open Graph tags, and how they can help your applications stand out on social media platforms! I updated my deployed app section
            to utilize react-multi-carousel instead of a flex-box. I think it gives off a cleaner look, and I have always been a fan of the image carousels
            on other websites. I plan on learning React Native next to further strengthen my Javascript skills. Plus I already love React js!
            Check back next week to see what I'm working on next!</p>
