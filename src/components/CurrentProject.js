            on completing an AWS course. I'm currently working on a chat application built with Node js and Socket.io. I added a Deployment section to my
            website now that I've deployed a couple applications. I plan on adding more applications to that section as I continue to grow and learn as a
            software engineer. I start my offical job search with Flatiron next week after completing Mod 6!
            Check back next week to see what I'm working on next!</p>
