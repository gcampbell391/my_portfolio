# A portfolio site about Gene Campbell III
My portfolio app was built with React js. I used a couple npm libaries to 
implement some cool features. 

- react-responsive-carousel to display image and app carousels
- react-reveal for scroll animations
- react-typist to display the text typing and deleting 
- react-blink-text to make full stack software engineer blink
- react-youtube to easily display my youtube videos 
- tsparticles to display beautiful flying particles 
- react-chartkick to display the git commit line graph

Thanks for checking my site out!
